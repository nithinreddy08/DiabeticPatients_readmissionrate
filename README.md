# DiabeticPatients_readmissionrate

This project focuses on identifying the key reasons for hospital readmissions among diabetic patients within 30 days of treatment. Diabetes, a condition caused by excessive glucose in the blood due to insufficient insulin, can lead to serious complications like cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, and vision loss. Hospital readmissions are a significant concern, placing financial strain on healthcare systems and highlighting gaps in patient care. Using exploratory data analysis and machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting), this project aims to predict which patients are at risk of readmission. Evaluation metrics show that the Gradient Boosting model outperformed others in accuracy, with lower error rates across various metrics. The ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes by reducing readmission rates and enhancing diabetes management.
